        <from>Mr SPEAKER</from>
        <p>Honourable members, yesterday, Chris Hipkins asked that I consider the use of interim answers to written parliamentary questions. He was concerned that Ministers are giving interim answers to a wide range of written parliamentary questions and, potentially, deferring the obligation to provide an answer until after the Parliament is dissolved.</p>

        <p>Interim replies should only be used in exceptional cases. Every endeavour must be made to provide a full reply within the period specified in Standing Orders. They are not to be used as a matter of course or just because a Minister has a large volume of questions to answer. Answering questions is a duty of office for Ministers and, if they give an interim reply, they are under an obligation to follow up with a full reply as soon as possible. A question is not regarded as being answered until the final response is received (SR 201/3,4,5). If an interim response is to be provided, the Minister should not routinely wait until the due date to provide it. Usually, it will be apparent to the Minister's office, when it receives a question, whether an interim reply will be required.</p>

        <p>I would be concerned if Ministers ever used interim replies to avoid providing answers to questions. There is now only a short amount of time left to lodge written questions, since they may be only lodged up until the time the Parliament is dissolved. It is my expectation that written questions lodged 6 or more working days before the dissolution of this Parliament will receive a substantive reply unless doing so requires an exceptional amount of collation and research. If members feel that they have received an interim reply when it is not justified, they should raise it with the Minister immediately and, if still not satisfied, bring it to my attention.</p>

        <p>We will begin the daily routine.</p>

         <p> to the Minister for Social Development: Does she stand by her statement yesterday that the Ministry of Social Development Household Incomes report shows "both lower and higher income households are getting the benefit of a strong and growing economy"; if so, does that statement take into account rising housing costs?</p>

         <p>Yes. As I said in the House yesterday, the report shows that the net improvement at the top of each income decile has been reasonably even across the board, which means that the 11 percent increase above inflation since 2008 is fairly evenly distributed. I refer the member to figure D.10 on page 76 of the incomes report, which shows the real equivalised household incomes after housing costs changes for the top of deciles from 2008-09 to 2015-16, which shows households have growing income across the spectrum.</p>

        <heading>Part 1 Substantive amendments to principal Act</heading>

         <from>CHRIS BISHOP (National)</from>
         <p>So Part 1 of the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification (Interim Restriction Order Classification) Amendment Bill—a catchy title, as my colleague Maggie Barry said during the second reading of this bill—deals with the substantive amendments to the principal Act, which is, of course, the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993. The Act been amended a couple of times—I think probably more than a couple of times—over the last 24 years since it was passed. It is probably an Act that is need of a bit more of a substantive review as we move into the internet age. But what this bill does is make a couple of very small but, I think, very useful changes to advance and improve freedom of expression in New Zealand.</p>

        <p>In the first and second readings of this bill members in the House canvassed the issues around the book <em>Into the River</em>, which was the genesis for this bill, basically—the unfortunate events of 2015 around <em>Into the River</em>, the award-winning novel by Ted Dawe. What happened there—and I do not want to traverse again the potted history—</p>

          <p>No, that would be irrelevant.</p>
